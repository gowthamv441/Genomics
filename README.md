# Genomics
Final Year Project Repository for correlating the personality trait with the diseases

## Base Papers

```
Holds the Reference Papers for the project (Correlating Personality vs diseases using Genomes)
```

## Data augmentation
```
Holds Code for image modification in multiple ways to be precise 20 in our case
```

## gene image dataset

```
Holds the image representation of the genes which acts as the primitive dataset for our project
```

## Genomics and bioinformatics (T.R. Sharma)

```
holds the PPT for the book genomics and bioinformatics by T.R. Sharma. Gives basic knowledge on the genomic data.
```

## image folding

```
Holds the Code for the horizontal and vertical folding of the images which is created from the gene image dataset
```

## Pairwise Sequence Alignment

```
Holds the Code which emphasize the inference computation of single gene sequence by traditional way vs CNN way
```

## Parsing data

```
  Parse the gene sequence from the sequence and transform it into a image. Which is going to be fed into the CNN network for the identification of gene with the gene sequence
```

## Review representation

```
Holds the documents and PPTs submitted on each review
```


## Sequence data

```
  Holds the Gene Sequence Which is identified as these are the ones that are most relatable with personality
```

## template matching

```
Holds the template matching of two images with 6 methods provided by open cv
```
